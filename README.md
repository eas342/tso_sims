# Simple Scripts for Simulating Time Series with pyNRC

These require a specific branch of pyNRC

https://github.com/eas342/pynrc/tree/dmsData

which in turns requires, `astropy`, `webbpsf` and `pysynphot` and their associated data files.

## Example usage

    python quick_grism_sim.py 
    python quick_image_sim.py
    python comb_img.py
